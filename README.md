# Real Time Face Detection using Viola-Jones and CAMSHIFT in Python

This repository mainly deals about real time Face Detection on a HD video (Last Week Tonight with John Oliver) using combined approach of Viola-Jones and CAMSHIFT. The prerequisites are a brief understanding about Viola-Jones face detection model using Haar features and CAMSHIFT algorithm for tracking object along with a fair amount of patience. If you are not interested in any explanation then here is the link to the [code](https://github.com/rahulptel/realtime-facedetection-hd-videos/tree/master/Part-I/VJCMS.rar). Go get it!

Starter codes for face detection in OpenCV using Haar features along with a crisp background on them are available at following links.
